# 🎮 add-one-line-of-code

Welcome to **add-one-line-of-code** — the open source 2D web game where *anyone can contribute by adding just one line of code!* 🎉

This is a collaborative and beginner-friendly project designed to evolve one line at a time. Whether you're new to coding, curious about game development, or just want to leave your mark — you're in the right place.

---

## 💡 What's the Idea?

We’ve built a super simple 2D game using TypeScript and HTML Canvas. But here’s the twist:

> 💬 **Every contribution should add *at least* one line of code.**

One line can:
- Add a platform  
- Spawn an enemy  
- Play a sound  
- Change the player color  
- Create a new level  
- Add a new message  
- ...or do something weird and fun!

Let’s build a game *together*, one line at a time — or more if it makes sense!
